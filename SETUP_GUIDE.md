# Personal Automation Agents - Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Your automation agents are ready! Here's what you need to do to get them fully working:

## 1. Gmail App Password Setup

**IMPORTANT**: You need to create an App Password for Gmail, not use your regular password.

### Steps:
1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Click "Security" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Signing in to Google", click "2-Step Verification"
4. Scroll down and click "App passwords"
5. Select "Mail" and "Windows Computer"
6. Click "Generate"
7. Copy the 16-character password (it looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)
8. Update your `config.env` file:

```bash
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password_here
```

## 2. Test Your Agents

### Test Basic Functionality:
```bash
python simple_test.py
```

### Test CV Enhancement (AI-powered):
```bash
python cli.py cv enhance --role "Software Engineer" --text "Python developer with 5 years experience"
```

### Test Email Processing:
```bash
python cli.py email process --hours 24
```

### Test Job Search:
```bash
python cli.py job search --max-apps 5
```

## 3. What Each Agent Does

- `.env` - Backup config (you can delete this)

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Email Notifications Not Working?
- Check your Gmail App Password
- Make sure 2FA is enabled on your Google account
- Verify the password in `config.env`

### AI Enhancement Not Working?
- Your OpenAI API key is already configured

## 6. Next Steps

- âœ… Email sending requires your approval (configurable)
- âœ… All actions are logged for transparency
